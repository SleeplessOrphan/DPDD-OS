## Introduction

The Digital Production, Design, and Development T Level is a technical qualification designed to prepare students for a career in the digital sector. This specialism focuses on the practical application of digital technologies in production, design, and development, with an emphasis on real-world projects and scenarios.

This repository is intended to be a guide for students pursuing the occupational specialism, providing a clear path from the initial concepts to the final assessment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this specialism, you should be able to:

1. **Understand digital production processes**: Learn how digital products are conceived, designed, and developed from start to finish.
2. **Develop practical skills**: Gain hands-on experience in coding, designing, and managing digital projects.
3. **Apply problem-solving techniques**: Use analytical thinking to overcome challenges during the production and development phases.
4. **Collaborate effectively**: Work in teams to produce digital solutions, understanding the roles and responsibilities within a project.
5. **Prepare for industry roles**: Develop the skills and knowledge necessary to transition into roles such as a junior developer, digital designer, or project manager.

## Structure of the Occupational Specialism

The specialism is divided into several key modules, each focusing on different aspects of digital production, design, and development:

1. **Digital Production Fundamentals**:
    - Introduction to digital tools and techniques
